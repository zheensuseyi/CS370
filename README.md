# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this project was to make an intelligent Pirate Agent that was able to get to the treasure in the most optimial way possible. The majority of the code in this project was already given to me. The part of the code which I actually did was the Q-Training Algorithm Code Block. Starting from "for epoch in range(n_epoch):" to "loss = model.evaluate(inputs, targets)" was the code I wrote for my pirate intelligent agent.
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
A "Computer Scientist" is a broad term for a professsional who specializes in skills like programming, software/algorithm development, and AI along with many more fields. Computer scientists increase efficiency and innovate everyday in order to make people's lives better. Without Computer Scientists, there would be no social media, no videogames, and no software!
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, the way I approach a problem is by first understanding what the program actually entails. Once I actually understand what needs to be done, I try to do it not only right but in a neat way so that even those without technical knowledge can understand why it works.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My code should be safe and secure and user data should be protected. GDPR guidelines should always be followed and one should be a professional during work.
